== STUPD CI

  First thing: I decided not to spend big chunk of time on beginning of
  this project on inventing a nice name for it. So it's just for now. It will be changed.

== TODOS

  Currently focused on making it work with rails tests and git as VCS.

  Planned features that made me start this project (to keep in my mind while developing):
  * ability to tell on which commit given error appeared for the first time (and associated
    with this be able to tell if commit was OK even if some tests are still failing if they
    were failing already before)
  * randomness awareness (possibility to run test more times when there are no new commits
    to be able to tell if some of encountered errors are random, mark them properly then)
  * be able to also run on branches (would be cool, of course may be tricky when config
    files changes and so on)

  Assumptions:
  * even though it's gonna be ruby & git only for now, make it modular so that either test
    runner or VCS can be added without rewrites
